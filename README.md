# EXT2 Filesystem Consistency Analysis

This project is based on an assignment for UCLA's undergraduate-level course -- Operating Systems Principles. The project objectives include:

- Reinforce the basic file system concepts of directory objects, file objects, and free space.
- Gain experience examining, interpreting and processing information in complex binary data structures.
- Reinforce the notions of consistency and integrity and apply them to a concrete and non-trivial problem.


# Details

In this project, we perform consistency analysis on EXT2 filesystem summaries. Specifically, we perform:

- Block Consistency Audits
- I-node Allocation Audits
- Directory Consistency Audits
